## What is [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)?
The tldr-pages project is a collection of community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement to traditional man pages.

Maybe you are new to the command-line world? Or just a little rusty? Or perhaps you can't always remember the arguments to lsof, or tar?

It certainly doesn't help that the first option explained in man tar is:

-b blocksize
   Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.
   As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading from or writing to tape drives,
   and usually not even then as the default block size of 20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.
There seems to be room for simpler help pages, focused on practical examples. How about:

# Enter tldr-Jquery-client

####Jquery Client for [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)
I thought it would be a good idea to write a client in only jquery, coz then I do not have to install nodejs for creating a webapp.
See more clients [here](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr#clients)
